Usage

    Prepare your data:

        Create a CSV file named data.csv containing your data. The file should have the following format:
        date	value
        2022-01-01	10
        2022-01-02	15
        2022-01-03	8
        ...	...

        Save the CSV file in the project directory.

    Run the script:



    python dashboard_builder.py

    Follow the prompts and instructions displayed in the terminal to build your dashboard:
        Validate the data.
        Select visualizations.
        Customize the dashboard.
        Filter the data.
        Export the dashboard as a PDF or HTML file.

    Once you complete the dashboard building process, the resulting dashboard file will be saved in the project directory.

Note: The script uses the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for data visualization. You may need to have these libraries installed in your Python environment.
