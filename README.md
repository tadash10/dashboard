    Data Refresh Automation: Implement an automated data refresh mechanism that periodically updates the data in the dashboard. This ensures that the dashboard always displays the most up-to-date information without requiring manual intervention.

    Data Source Integration: Extend the script to support integration with popular data sources and APIs. This allows users to directly connect to their data sources and fetch data in real-time, eliminating the need for manual data exports and imports.

    User Authentication and Access Control: Add user authentication and access control features to the dashboard. This allows multiple users to access and interact with the dashboard while maintaining proper security and privacy controls.

    Dashboard Sharing and Collaboration: Implement features that enable users to share their dashboards with others and collaborate on the same dashboard. This can include options to generate shareable links, export dashboards as standalone files, or integrate with collaboration tools for real-time collaboration.
